# Boost
###  *Pump up your workspace!*

Boost was created by Daniel Kong, Brett Landau, Julie Wang, Allen Zhu at HackGT 6: Into the Rabbit Hole (October 25-27 2019). Our Slack app allows workplaces to seamlessly integrate Bose SoundTouch Family Speakers in their Slack channels. We provide functionality to play/pause, skip, set volume, power on/off, and mute. Also included is a *text-to-speech* command that allows you to broadcast important messages across your entire workspace.
